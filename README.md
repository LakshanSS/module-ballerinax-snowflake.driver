[Snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/index.html) is one of the few enterprise-ready cloud data warehouses that brings simplicity without sacrificing features. It automatically scales, both up and down, to get the right balance of performance vs. cost. Snowflake’s claim to fame is that it separates compute from storage. Snowflake enables data storage, processing, and analytic solutions that are faster, easier to use, and far more flexible than traditional offerings. Snowflake provides all of the functionality of an enterprise analytic database, along with many additional special features and unique capabilities.

The Snowflake [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/) driver library bundles the [Snowflake JDBC driver v3.13.6](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/jdbc.html) through Ballerina. With this library, you can programmatically create and manage all Snowflake objects, including virtual warehouses, databases, and all database objects. It also provides the capability to query Snowflake data.
